        nutrients in. There are many fad diets people decide to start their
        weightloss journey with because they want an easy way out. A lot have
        been successful in losing those extra pounds. However, none of them are
        sustainable. I am here to tell you that there aren't really any tricks
        to losing weight. Let me show you the two main aspects to losing weight

        <li>
          <strong>Excerise:</strong> For a more sustainable weightloss, working
          out every single day even if its just for 30 minutes will keep the
          extra pounds off. Slow, steady workouts are best because they are ones
          you can do every day whether you are traveling, at work, at home, etc.
